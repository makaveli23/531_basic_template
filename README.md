# 531_basic_template

This training program follows "The Simplest Strength Template" as described by Jim in his 531 Second Edition book.

This readme file assumes you know the book/lifting terminology, and you know the meaning and how to calculate your TMs based on your 1RPMs 

Usage:

	-To get the initial setup running you will need to manually insert you TM values for the correct lifts into the correct text files in the trainingMaxes directory
	 future updates will change this and you will be able to do it in the program itself. (A calculator to calculate your 1RPM and your TM automatically based on your
	 max effort sets might also come in the future) 
	 WARING: This step in very important because for now (will also change later) if you try to run the program with empty text files you will get errors

	-After you have the initial confiration done (writing your TMs in the text files) you can view your cycle work in the option 1 of the main menu

	-You can also view at anytime you current TMs and 1RPMs in the option 2 of the menu
	
	-You will only need to write directly in the text files yourself one time, after the initial configuration is done, increases/decreases in your TMs should be done 
	 in the option 3 of the main menu (it follows the book progression system (2.5kg for upper body, 5kg for lower) with the adicional option of doing a double increase
